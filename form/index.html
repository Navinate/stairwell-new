        <h1>Hi, I’m XX,</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
           Somebody asked me how I was doing today and I said good.
          </br></br>And then they asked, “How are you really?” And then I thought, hmm.. 
          </br></br>How am I really? 
          </br></br>So I thought I’d check in with myself. This is how I did it…

        <p class="intro-text">
          I thought about the past few weeks and answered a few questions. 
          As I answered each question, I was able to animate XX name
          </br></br>Then, I launched how I was feeling onto the StairWELL and watched my mood light up the sculpture,
          move, make sound, and interact with the moods of others.

        <img src="../assets/kiki.png" alt="image of the stairWELL mascot, Kiki" />
        <p class="intro-text">
          Along the way I thought about why I was feeling the way I was. 
          </br></br>Where had I been coming from? Where was I headed to? Who had I been spending time with… 
          </br></br>A couple weeks ago I may have been feeling some kind of way but today I might feel another.

          So Draw a squiggle that captures how you’re feeling
          </br></br>Feel free to try a few different times and then hit next.
